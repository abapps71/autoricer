## What is this?

This is a side-project I made to make my life easier when I want to migrate to a new machine or clean format my own machine and have my customized setup in place without much effort. I made one simple shell script that does it all. Some features of my setup are mentioned in my personal config [repo](https://github.com/salil-sudo/arcorice). Any feature update will be mentioned [there](https://github.com/salil-sudo/arcorice) and not here. Although this repository and my personal config [repo](https://github.com/salil-sudo/arcorice) are almost same. I prefer to keep them separate.
